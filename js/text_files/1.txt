<h1>Getting Around!</h1>
<br>
If you haven't already, click on the minimap to recenter yourself on Rameses.
<br>
<br>
The Rameses you see on the screen is a visual representation of a JavaScript object named <code>rameses</code>.
<br>
<br>
Rameses has a few built in methods that you can use to move him around the map:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
rameses.moveUp();
       .moveDown();
       .moveLeft();
       .moveRight();
</pre>
<br><br>
These methods do what you expect them to, and each takes one integer as input for the distance in blocks you want Rameses to move. Rameses will stop all movement if he runs into a building or reaches the map's edges.
<br>

<br>
You can also access Ramesesâ€™s current location with: 
<br><br>

<pre>
var x = rameses.X;
var y = rameses.Y;
</pre>

<br><br>
Try to move Rameses around by using the above methods in the code editor! The myScript.js tab is the place for you to run all the code that you want to run. Once, you start making your own functions, the myFunctions.js tab is where you can put them to make your code look cleaner. You can then call your functions in the myScript.js tab. The ramesesFunctions.js tab contains all of the built-in methods you can use with Rameses. Some of them may be too advanced for you right now but hopefully by the end of the game you'll be able to use and understand them.

THIS IS A COMMENT

Since the game reads these text files as HTML, you can use HTML tags to format
your lessons. Some things to remember:

Use <br> tags for linebreaks. Use one to go down a line, use two for a clean
paragraph break.

Use <i class="fa fa-ICON"><i> for special icons. Look up font-awesome icons

Use <code></code> for very short code-like items such as object and variable
names.

Use <pre></pre> for long blocks of code (See above for example). All whitespace
and linebreaks are preserved within these tags;
