<h1>Using Several Tools at the Same Time</h1>
<br>
<br>
Return values allow us to use functions as parameters for other functions. This means we have an extra tool to use when writing functions. The reason this works is because parameters allow us to gain access to values we normally would not have access to. Return values are so important because, they make the result of the function's calculations available for us to use in other calculations.
<br><br>
This can be done if you have another function that you have already created. For example, if you wanted to make a function that multiplied a number by 2, you could use an add function to add it twice and return you that value, which you could use for something else.
<br><br>
<pre>
var multby2 = function(aNumber){
  return add(aNumber,aNumber);
}
</pre>
