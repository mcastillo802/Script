<h1>Giving Rameses Tools</h1>
<br><br>
We have also given you the ability to give Rameses tools to use by adding functions to "myFunctions.js". Rameses can use these tools without having to learn how they work. 
<br>
For example if you wanted to let Rameses calculate sales tax for an item in NC, you could do so by adding the following to "myFunctions.js":
<br><br>

<pre>
var sales_tax_calc = function(item_price){
	return item_price * 0.0475;
};
</pre>
<br><br> 
You could then do the following in "myScript.js":
<br><br>
<pre>
rameses.alert("The sales tax on a $5 Cookout tray is " +
sales_tax_calc(5));
</pre>
<br><br>
As you can see <code>item_price</code> is needed to make the calculation work. This value is known as a parameter. It is an additional value you can give to the function to make sure it has access to all the things it needs to work correctly, however parameters are not always necessary.
<br><br>
There is no need to assign the sales tax to a variable because <code>return</code> assigns a value to <code>sales_tax_calc(5)</code> which can then be printed. If you wanted to go even further you could also add a function that gives you the total price including sales tax.
